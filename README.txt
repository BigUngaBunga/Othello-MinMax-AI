To run the program in the editor the monogame framework must be downloaded.

After starting the program the upper middle button is used to toggle the AI on or off.
If the AI button is green the game is played against an AI opponent, otherwise it is a player vs player game.
The button below it starts the game and the small coloured boxes to either side shows the current colour of each player.
